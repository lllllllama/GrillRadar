## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)

### Git Workflow
- **Branch naming:** `claude/[feature-description]-[session-id]`
- **Commit messages:** Clear, descriptive messages following conventional commits
- **Commits:** Atomic commits with related changes grouped together

### Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing
- Target: [Test coverage goal TBD]

### Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Watch for: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, etc.
