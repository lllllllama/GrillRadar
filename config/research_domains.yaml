# Meta-configuration for research domains
meta:
  how_to_add_new_domain:
    - "Copy an existing domain template"
    - "Fill in conferences (use official acronyms)"
    - "List core topics (5-15 items)"
    - "Provide recommended search queries"
    - "Add common methods (optional)"
    - "Specify evaluation metrics (optional)"

  guidance:
    - "NEVER fabricate specific paper titles or authors"
    - "Reference conferences by name only (e.g., 'read recent CVPR papers on X')"
    - "Suggest search queries for students to explore (e.g., 'search for Y survey')"
    - "Focus on general methodologies, not specific implementations"
    - "Keep information factual and verifiable"
